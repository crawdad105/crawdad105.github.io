                Crawdad105 is the hit youtuber who tends to primarily post about Terraria content, i assume you already know what Terraria is so i wont go in depth with that but as it is seen on Crawdad105's channel he also played Minecraft. The Dome Depo SMP was the first proper account of Minecraft being played on the channel, there was also Minecraft content that came out over 3 years ago, but that content is old, outdated, no longer relevant, bad, terrible and generally should be deleted off of the platform. The playing of Minecraft and Terraria on his channel would suggest Crawdad105’s preferred games are more survival, explorer, and creative based. Crawdad105 has a variety of social media accounts linked to discord and youtube. Before youtube it was rumored that he still made videos just ones that were never released on youtube, the oldest known video was from 2015 around 4 years before the first video in the channel was uploaded. Going even further back he said in an interview that never happened “all my life I've been wanting to make youtube videos, then one day i recorded a video, but it would bever be uploaded”, breaking this down you can conclude that Crawdad105’s intentions of becoming a youtuber were inevitable from the beginning. Other than youtube Crawdad105 is almost always active on one of many social medias, although there are no posts on many he still does have accounts that exist. Discord is where Crawdad105 is most active, always being onlines whether or not he is actually at his pc. Crawdad105 has many discord accounts and many public discord server, including TerraBlock, Bean Simulatore and one for just his youtube viewers. Crawdad105 also creates games on itch.io many are short however Bean Simulaotre and Cheese Forest, his newest game, aren't as short as others and could make for a fun playthrough. As of writing this 3ed person autobiography Cheese Forest is the largest and probably longest game he has uploaded. Measuring it at over 1GB (unzipped) Cheese Forest has become the life of Crawdad105, video creation has currently been halted due to the creation of Cheese Forest. Bean simulator as many people don't know is the hit game, it is a first person idle/clicker game where you have to go around beating stuff up to collect money and buy weapons like a turd and a bean. There is an entire video on Crawdad105’s youtube channel about the game and how it's actually the best game, and I recommend giving it a watch. Other videos on Crawdad105’s channel contain game trailers for Cheese Forest and Room Simulator. Room Simulator was a short now discontinued game where there was an entity that knocks on your door and when you go to check who it is the door closes and locks, you then are locked out of your room. To avoid spoiling the game I won't go into too much depth but I've literally just sad the entire game, as the game was a short test demo for whomever played it. Room Simulator was suspiciously similar to another game by Crawdad105 which was called Liminal Room, this one has more gameplay and technically a real ending. This one also contains the same starting point as the first ever game uploaded the the Crawdad105 itch.io account which was called siren head short. The game was shown in the video “Why haven't I been Uploading?” which was the marking the return of Crawdad105 after his 8 months of not posing, on the Crawdad105 timeline (this was said in an interview that never happened) this event marked 0, anything before this was BB which stands for before break after this video the channel entered a new era where there content was no longer as bad as it was and more effort was put into them. On another note going back to the beginning of this short text, Crawdad105 posts mainly Terraria content, this is due to the growing popularity of TerraBlock survival sky island map created for Terraria. This map was the hardest known sky island map that Crawdad105 could find. There are some people who think there smart and aren't, for example on the download page on steam for this map there is someone claiming that the map is easy however not only are they wrong but in there explanation of how the game is easy they faculty softlock them self, by explaining how you turn the all dirt into mud however ding this could soft lock you. The 1.4.4 update of Terraria brought a whole new mechanic to the game, evil mud grass. This evil mud grass might make the game possible with as little as only 4 mud blocks. A video explaining this concept was meant to come out on Crawdad105’s channel however it has not, maybe he is working on it but as of now there is no mention of it. On the other side of Terraria in the modded world, Crawdad105 has made a mod for it, not only that but he has created a tool to help others seamlessly create mods without any coding. So far it has a total of 0 downloads because idk, but hopefully in the future as time goes on it will be able to do more and more eventually hopefully making its way to being a well known way to create mods. Mod creation was also something that Crawdad105 did for Minecraft, as he said in discord somewhere probably, the mod was created using MCreator which involved no coding whatsoever. The mod is still downloadable and adds around 10 new ores to find and a new dimension, the mod was also said to have the moon as a new dimension but since the mod is no longer in development this seems to be like it will no longer happen. Another thing that might not happen is the Crawdad105 iceberg. As you already know icebergs have lore and Crawdad105 also has lore. This iceberg was first leaked on the TerraBlock discord server, it has everything from what happened before youtube to things that everyone knows about, the video was supposed to come out eventually however it has not come out yet. There is no telling when it will come out however as time goes on more and more will be added, like this for example, this text contains a lot previously untold lore. Going back to Crawdad105 he is around 3 foot 32 inches maybe he lives in canada and his address is… no i am not telling you his address, if you want to know where he lives go to a discord server, this address was leaked by his alt kind of, but the videos now have been removed from his channel, you can no longer dox him, however, unless you really want to your best bet is not on his channel there are other channels showing him and by using the sun's rotation you can probably find the rough location and using other clips you can probably narrow down his location. However keep in mind doxing someone is a crime, i learnt this out the hard way, i also shouldn't be saying this. Crawdad105’s usernames, again said in an interview that never happened, comes from his nickname of Crawdad but everyone has Crawdad as their nickname so the number 105 was chosen, it was chosen by his brother and has no meaning whatsoever, however now it is the identifying trait of him.
